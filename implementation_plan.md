# Implementation Plan — PriPriTrip (rebuild)

## Summary

Rebuild PriPriTrip on `project-template`, from the trip document outward. Phase 0
reset the repo onto the template. The crawl phases then go in order:

1. Define the trip document: Pydantic models, generated JSON Schema, and DB tables.
2. Import it and read it back through the API.
3. Build the home screen (trip list and import).
4. Build the trip timeline.

After Phase 4, Julian provides a real itinerary, which we convert to a trip
document and import. Editing and verification are walk/run work, listed in the
backlog.

## Architecture Decisions

- **The trip document is the contract.** `TripDocument` (Pydantic, in
  `api/app/trip_document.py`) is the single source of truth.
  `schema/trip.schema.json` is *generated* from it (`make schema`), and a test
  fails if the committed file is stale. `GET /schema/trip` serves the same
  schema.
- **Bookings live at trip level; plans live in days.**
  - `stays[]` and `travels[]` are trip-level lists with their own rules.
  - `days[].items[]` are activities only.
  - Nothing derived is ever stored. The timeline computes its markers from
    stays and travels at render time, in one pure UI function
    (`buildTimeline`). The API stores exactly what the document says.
- **What counts as travel:** a booked or scheduled leg (flight, train, bus,
  ferry, car). Incidental movement ("walk to the old town", "taxi to the hotel")
  is an activity with notes.
- **Import always creates.** `POST /trips/import` builds a brand-new trip. The
  schema has no id fields, so a document can't carry ids. Nothing is updated,
  merged or replaced.
- **All-or-nothing, reject on any error.** Every error is returned in one 422
  response, each with a JSON path (for example `days[2].items[0].start`).
  Validation has two layers:
  1. Structural: Pydantic and the JSON Schema.
  2. Cross-field rules, which a JSON Schema can't express. These are listed in
     the schema's `description` so external authors can see them.
- **One write path.** All trip writes go through `services/trips.py`. The
  import, and later editing, call it. Routers stay thin (template convention).
- **Read shape = document shape.** `GET /trips/{id}` returns the
  `TripDocument` shape plus ids and audit fields. The UI renders from it, and a
  future "export" is the same payload.
- **Tables:** `trips`, `stays`, `travels`, `days`, `items`.
  - All have UUID PKs and the soft-delete mixin.
  - `trips.user_id` holds ownership. Children are reached only through an owned
    trip (`get_owned_trip`, 404 otherwise).
  - Days are unique per `(trip_id, date)` among live rows (a partial unique
    index).
  - `stays`, `travels` and `items` carry a `position`: the document order.
  - Locations are a JSON column (`location`, `from_location`, `to_location`),
    not a table.
- **SQLite gotcha.** Foreign keys are not enforced unless
  `PRAGMA foreign_keys=ON` is set on each connection, so it's enabled on engine
  connect for the app and the tests.
- **Eager loading only.** Relationships are `lazy="raise"`, and the trip is
  assembled with `selectinload(...)` plus the soft-delete filter. A forgotten
  load fails loudly in tests instead of raising `MissingGreenlet` at runtime
  (lessons §11).
- **Time model** (lessons §3):
  - Plain dates are `DATE`.
  - Wall-clock values are a naive `DATETIME` plus a nullable IANA zone string.
    `null` means the trip's `timezone`; every override, including a travel's
    `arriveTimezone`, falls back to the trip's zone.
  - `Trip.timezone` is required, and every zone is checked with `zoneinfo`.
  - UTC instants are computed only to compare values in different zones (for
    example, arrive vs depart on a cross-zone flight). They are never stored
    for trip content.
- **Wall-clock format on the wire:** `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM`, seconds optional, no
  offset. A value with an offset or `Z` is rejected, and so is a non-string.
- **Import rules** (any failure rejects the import):
  1. `endDate ≥ startDate`.
  2. Every `days[].date` is within the trip range, with no duplicate dates.
  3. Activity `start`, when present, is on its day's date. `end` requires
     `start` and must come after it (same zone, so compared directly).
  4. A stay's `checkOut > checkIn`, compared as instants. `checkIn` falls
     within the trip range, and `checkOut` is no later than `endDate + 1 day`.
  5. A travel's `depart` is required and falls within the trip range. `arrive`
     is optional, must come after `depart` (as instants), and is no later than
     `endDate + 1 day`.
  6. Unknown fields are rejected (`extra="forbid"`), so typos fail loudly
     instead of being dropped.
  7. `lat` and `lng` are given together or not at all, and must be in range.
  8. File limit: 1 MB, UTF-8 JSON.
- **Day view composition** (`buildTimeline`):
  - Every date from `startDate` to `endDate` gets a row. A date with no day
    entry and no markers shows "No plans".
  - **Stay markers:** check-in on the check-in date, "Staying at" on each
    night strictly between, and check-out on the check-out date.
  - **Travel markers:** depart on the departure date. When the arrival date is
    later, an "Arrive" marker goes on the arrival date too.
  - **Ordering within a day:**
    - Activities keep their document order.
    - A timed marker goes just before the first *timed* activity that starts
      at or after it.
    - Untimed activities stay attached to whatever precedes them.
    - "Staying at" markers go first.
    - Markers at the same time are ordered check-out, then depart, then
      arrive, then check-in.
- **Frontend:**
  - Features: `features/trips/` (home, import, delete) and
    `features/timeline/` (trip view), one slice each.
  - Times are shown verbatim via `shared/utils/time.js`. Never call
    `dayjs(isoString)` on a wall-clock value.
  - `react-markdown` + `remark-gfm` render notes and summaries.
  - The dialog is hand-rolled in the template's shadcn *shape* (no Radix),
    matching the existing components.
- **The `things` example slice is removed** in Phase 2, once trips replace it as
  the reference slice.

## Open Questions / Design Decisions

All answered 2026-10-01/02 and folded into the body above.

1. **Stays at trip level?** **Answer:** yes. **Resolved:** stays are a
   trip-level list with their own rules, never derived into days.
2. **Markdown in notes/summaries?** **Answer:** yes. **Resolved:** rendered with
   `react-markdown` + `remark-gfm`.
3. **Keep template login and per-user ownership?** **Answer:** yes.
   **Resolved:** every trip is owned by a user; foreign trips return 404.
4. **Invalid import?** **Answer:** reject for now, relax later. **Resolved:**
   all-or-nothing, every error returned with its path.
5. **v1 material?** **Answer:** `reference/` folder. **Resolved:** done in
   Phase 0.
6. **Dates with no `days[]` entry?** **Answer:** show them (recommended).
   **Resolved:** every date in range renders, and an empty one shows
   "No plans".
7. **Overnight travel?** **Answer:** show on the arrival date (recommended).
   Then superseded by Q9: an arrival on a later date gets its own "Arrive"
   marker.
8. **Item order within a day?** **Answer:** document order (recommended).
   **Resolved:** activities keep document order; markers merge in by time
   (Q9).
9. **Travel at trip level too?** **Answer:** yes (2026-10-02). **Resolved:**
   `travels[]` is a trip-level list, items are activity-only, and `depart` is
   required so every leg can be placed.
10. **Trip deletion in the UI?** **Answer:** yes (recommended). **Resolved:**
    soft delete from the home screen, behind a confirm dialog.
11. **What does `make seed` load?** **Answer:** a sample trip (recommended).
    **Resolved:** the seed user gets the synthetic sample trip
    (`api/app/sample_data/sample_trip.json`), which is also the test fixture
    and the schema example.

## Phase 0 — Reset onto the template ✅

**Goal:** the repo is the template, green, with v1 knowledge preserved.

**Scope:**
- `rebuild` branch. Old code removed (it's still on `main`'s history and on
  `llm-translate`).
- Template tracked files dropped in via `git archive`.
- `reference/` holds the v1 docs, data and verify fixtures, plus a gitignored
  `private/` (old PDFs and notes, old `.env` backups).
- `docs/lessons_learned.md`, `functional_spec.md` and this plan.

**Tests / verification:**
- [x] `make setup`, `make seed`, `make verify` green (7 API + 7 UI tests)
- [x] API boots, `/health` ok, seeded user can log in and hit an authenticated
      endpoint; UI dev server serves on :3000

---

## Phase 1 — Crawl: Trip document, schema & models ✅

**Goal:** the trip document is defined, validated, published as a JSON Schema,
and has tables to land in.

**Scope:**
- `api/app/trip_document.py`:
  - `TripDocument`, `StayDoc`, `TravelDoc`, `DayDoc`, `ItemDoc`, `LocationDoc`,
    all with `extra="forbid"`.
  - `WallClock` and `IanaTimezone` types.
  - `validate_trip_document(data) -> TripDocument`, which raises
    `TripDocumentError([{path, message}, ...])` and covers both the structural
    errors and rules 1–7.
- `schema/trip.schema.json`, generated by `make schema` (`python -m
  app.schema_export`), with descriptions on every field and the rules in the
  root description.
- SQLAlchemy models `Trip`, `Stay`, `Travel`, `Day`, `Item` per the
  Architecture Decisions, with `PRAGMA foreign_keys=ON`.
- `api/app/sample_data/sample_trip.json`. It covers:
  - a cross-zone overnight flight
  - a stay spanning two nights
  - trains
  - timed and untimed activities
  - a date with no day entry
  - markdown notes
- Dependencies: `tzdata` (runtime) and `jsonschema` (tests).

**Out of scope:** endpoints, UI.

**Tests / verification:**
- [x] `make verify` passes
- [x] The sample trip validates. Mutated copies each fail with the expected
      path, at least one per rule 1–7.
- [x] The committed `schema/trip.schema.json` equals the generated one
- [x] The sample validates against the JSON Schema itself (`jsonschema`), and
      the schema rejects an unknown field and an offset wall-clock value
- [x] `make reset-db` creates the new tables

---

## Phase 2 — Crawl: Import & read API ✅

**Goal:** a trip document goes in through the API and comes back out in the
same shape.

**Scope:**
- `services/trips.py`: `import_trip(db, user_id, doc) -> Trip` (one
  transaction), `list_trips`, `get_trip`, `delete_trip` (soft).
- `routers/trips.py`:
  - `POST /trips/import`: multipart `file`, or a raw JSON body for curl/tests.
    Returns 201 with the trip summary.
  - `GET /trips`: summaries with counts, soonest start first.
  - `GET /trips/{id}`: the full document plus ids.
  - `DELETE /trips/{id}`: 204, soft delete.
  - `GET /schema/trip`: unauthenticated, read-only.
- Error responses:
  - 422 `{detail, errors: [{path, message}]}` for an invalid document.
  - 400 for malformed JSON or a missing file.
  - 413 for a file over 1 MB.
- Remove the `things` slice on the backend. (The frontend half moved to Phase 3,
  where its replacement page lands, so no commit has a home page without an
  API.) Seed replants the sample trip.

**Tests / verification:**
- [x] `make verify` passes
- [x] `make seed` covers this phase's new data, and the result is visible in the app (via API)
- [x] Round trip: import the sample, then `GET` equals the input (ignoring ids
      and audit fields)
- [x] Importing the same file twice creates two distinct trips
- [x] An invalid doc returns 422 with all errors and leaves no rows behind;
      bad JSON returns 400; an oversize file returns 413
- [x] Another user's trip returns 404 on GET and DELETE; an anonymous request
      returns 401
- [x] A deleted trip disappears from `GET /trips` and returns 404 on `GET /trips/{id}`

---

## Phase 3 — Crawl: Home screen (trip select & import) ✅

**Goal:** after logging in, I see my trips, can import a new one, and can open
or delete one.

**Scope:**
- `features/trips/`: a trips slice (list, import, delete) and `TripsPage` at
  `/`.
  - Cards show name, date range, nights, and stay/travel counts.
  - An empty state has an "Import trip" button.
- An import dialog: file picker → upload.
  - Success: toast, then navigate to `/trips/:id`.
  - Failure: the dialog shows a path → message list.
- Delete through a confirm dialog with a destructive button.
- Remove the frontend `things` slice; `TripsPage` replaces `DashboardPage`.
- `shared/utils/time.js` (wall-clock and date formatting) with tests.

**Tests / verification:**
- [x] `make verify` passes
- [x] `make seed` covers this phase's new data, and the result is visible in the app
- [x] Component tests: list renders, empty state, import success navigates,
      import failure shows path-tagged errors, delete confirms first
- [ ] Manual: phone width (375px), dark theme, keyboard focus visible. (Agent checked
      headless screenshots at 375px; a human look is still the gate.)

---

## Phase 4 — Crawl: Trip timeline ✅

**Goal:** the trip reads well as an expandable day-by-day timeline.

**Scope:**
- `features/timeline/`: `TripTimelinePage` at `/trips/:id`.
  - Header: name, dates, timezone, and a back link.
  - Day rows show date, weekday and title, collapsed by default. Expanding
    shows the summary (markdown) and the day's entries.
  - Entry rows show an icon by kind and travel mode, the time (wall clock, with
    a zone label when it differs from the trip's), and the title. Expanding
    shows notes (markdown), location with a maps link, confirmation number, and
    travel details.
- `buildTimeline(trip)`: a pure function implementing the day-view
  composition rules above.
- Loading skeleton, and a not-found state.

**Tests / verification:**
- [x] `make verify` passes
- [x] `make seed` covers this phase's new data, and the result is visible in the app
- [x] `buildTimeline` unit tests:
      - a multi-night stay puts its markers on the right dates
      - an overnight cross-zone flight shows on both dates
      - empty dates
      - document order kept
      - markers merge in by time around untimed activities
- [x] Wall-clock formatting doesn't depend on the process `TZ`
- [x] Component tests: expand/collapse a day and an entry; markdown renders
- [ ] Manual: phone width, long titles wrap cleanly, dark-theme contrast. (Agent
      checked headless 375px screenshots with the browser set to
      Pacific/Auckland; a human look is still the gate.)

## Walk stage — editing day activities

Scope: create, update and delete **activities** (`days[].items[]`). Stays and
travels stay read-only. Their markers get no edit controls.

### Design (assuming the recommended answers below)

- **One write path:** every edit goes through new functions in
  `services/trips.py`.
- **Shared validation:** an edited activity is validated by the same code as an
  import.
  - The body is an `ItemDoc`, so structure and unknown-field rules are
    identical.
  - The per-activity rule (start on the day's date, end after start) is
    factored out of `check_rules` into `check_item`, which both import and edit
    call.
- **Full replace, not patch:** the form always sends the whole activity, so
  there's no absent-vs-null ambiguity (lessons §8).
- **Writes return the updated trip** (`TripRead`). The UI swaps it into state
  in one round trip, so nothing goes stale and `buildTimeline` just re-runs.
- **Endpoints**, all behind `get_owned_trip`. An activity on another trip, or a
  deleted one, returns 404.
  - `POST   /trips/{id}/items` takes an `ItemDoc` plus `date` and creates the
    activity at the end of that date. It creates the day row if the date has
    none. (The date is in the body rather than the URL, so create and replace
    take the same shape.)
  - `PUT    /trips/{id}/items/{item_id}` replaces an activity. If its `date`
    changes, it moves to the end of that day.
  - `DELETE /trips/{id}/items/{item_id}` soft-deletes it and returns the
    updated trip, like every other edit.
  - `PUT    /trips/{id}/days/{date}` sets the day's title and summary,
    creating the day row if needed (Q5).
  - `POST   /trips/{id}/items/{item_id}/move` with `{ "direction": "up" |
    "down" }` swaps the activity with its neighbour within the day.
- **UI:**
  - An "Add activity" button sits under each day's list.
  - An expanded activity shows Edit, Move up/down and Delete.
  - Edit and add use one hand-written `ActivityForm` in the Dialog, shaped as a
    bottom sheet on a phone. Fields:
    - Title
    - Day (select)
    - Start and end time
    - Location: name, address, link
    - Confirmation number
    - Notes (markdown textarea)
  - The form validates on submit. Server 422 paths are mapped onto the fields
    inline.
  - Delete asks for confirmation. Every write shows a toast.

### Phase 5 — Walk: activity edit API ✅

- `check_item` extracted; `create_item`, `replace_item`, `delete_item` and
  `move_item` added to `services/trips.py`; routes added.
- Tests:
  - Create on an existing day, and on a date with no day row.
  - Replace, including a move to another day.
  - 422 with paths.
  - Delete hides the activity from `GET`.
  - Move up/down, including at the ends of the list.
  - Foreign or deleted items return 404; anonymous requests return 401.
  - Import and edit reject the same bad activity the same way.

### Phase 6 — Walk: activity editing UI ✅

- `ActivityForm` (time inputs on the day's date; end before start rolls to
  the next day).
- Edit, add, move and delete wired into `TimelineEntry` and `DayPanel`, with
  `timelineSlice` thunks that replace the trip.
- Tests:
  - Add, then edit, then delete, with mocked API calls.
  - Inline field errors from a 422.
  - Markers have no edit controls.
  - Phone-width check. (Agent: a live add/edit run at 375px, with the save
    confirmed through the API. A human look is still the gate.)
- Also fixed: the Dialog re-ran its focus effect on every render, which pulled
  focus out of form fields mid-typing.

### Open questions (editing)

1. **Where do the edit controls live?**
   - (a) Inside an expanded activity, plus an "Add activity" button under each
     day.
   - (b) An "Edit day" mode that shows controls on every activity at once.
   - Recommendation: **(a)**. It reads cleanly and needs no mode.
   - **Answer:** recommended (2026-10-02).
2. **Reordering untimed activities: now or later?** Their position matters,
   because a marker merges in around them.
   - Options: Move up/down buttons now; drag-and-drop (needs a touch DnD
     library); or later.
   - Recommendation: **Move up/down now**.
   - **Answer:** recommended (2026-10-02).
3. **Move an activity to a different day?**
   - Recommendation: **yes**, via a Day select in the form. The activity lands
     at the end of the new day.
   - **Answer:** recommended (2026-10-02).
4. **Adding to a date with no day entry** (like May 10). A day row needs a
   title today.
   - (a) Make `DayDoc.title` optional. The tab and heading already fall back to
     the date. This is a small schema change, and the schema regenerates.
   - (b) Ask for a title when adding the first activity.
   - Recommendation: **(a)**.
   - **Answer:** recommended (2026-10-02).
5. **Edit the day's own title and summary now too?**
   - It's cheap with the same pattern (`PUT /trips/{id}/days/{date}`).
   - Recommendation: **yes**, as a small "Edit day" button in the panel
     header.
   - **Answer:** recommended (2026-10-02).
6. **Time entry.** The form takes times only, with the date coming from the
   day.
   - Recommendation: an end time earlier than the start rolls to the next day
     (22:00–01:00), shown as "+1".
   - **Answer:** recommended (2026-10-02).
7. **Timezone override and coordinates on an activity.**
   - Recommendation: **not in the form for now**. Existing values are
     preserved on save, and the map link uses the address when there are no
     coordinates. Places lookup is later.
   - **Answer:** recommended (2026-10-02).
8. **Write semantics.** Full replace (PUT) of the whole activity, or PATCH?
   - Recommendation: **PUT**.
   - **Answer:** recommended (2026-10-02).

## Walk stage 2 — editing stays & travel, and a vertical timeline (draft, awaiting answers)

Asked 2026-10-02:
- **Travel:** must have a type (fly, boat, train, …) and a departure date and
  location. The user sees a warning when the arrival is unset. Departure and
  arrival times are each in their own timezone.
- **Stays:** check-in and check-out are required.
- **Both:** confirmation number and the other booking details.
- **Timeline:** the UI should flow like a timeline, after react-chrono's
  vertical mode (each point is a date, its card is that day's details), which
  should suit a phone better.

### Findings: react-chrono

- `react-chrono@3.3.3` (current) peer-requires **React 19.2**. Every release
  from 2.7 on requires React 19. The last one supporting React 18 is
  **2.6.1**, which is about 18 months behind.
- We're on React 18.3 because that's what the template pins. Adopting chrono
  means either:
  - a React 19 upgrade, which moves us off the template; or
  - pinning a stale 2.x release.
- It's about 1.5 MB unpacked, with its own styling system (vanilla-extract)
  and a 36-property theme. We'd map that onto our design tokens (dark only,
  4px radius, borders over shadows) and then maintain the mapping.
- Card content can be our own components (`children`). Day expansion, the
  edit buttons and the markers would still be our code; chrono would only
  draw the line, the points and the scrolling.
- The vertical layout itself is small: a line, a dot per date, and a card per
  day, roughly 100 lines of Tailwind.
- **Recommendation:** build the vertical timeline ourselves, using chrono's
  vertical mode as the visual reference (see Q1).

### Design (assuming the recommended answers)

**Timeline (vertical):**
- One continuous vertical line down the left edge. Each date is a point on the
  line, labelled with the weekday, date and "Day N". Its card sits to the
  right.
- A **day card** holds the title, summary and entries (activities plus stay
  and travel markers, merged by time as today). Entries still expand to their
  details and actions.
- Day cards are **open by default**, so the page reads top to bottom like a
  story.
- A date with nothing on it gets a slim point with "No plans" and an "Add"
  action, not a full card.
- The tab strip becomes a **compact sticky date jumper** (Q3). Tapping a date
  scrolls to its card, and the jumper highlights whichever date is in view.
  `?day=` keeps working as a scroll target.

**Editing stays and travel**, following the same pattern as activities:
- **API:**
  - `POST /trips/{id}/stays`, `PUT|DELETE /trips/{id}/stays/{stay_id}`
  - `POST /trips/{id}/travels`, `PUT|DELETE /trips/{id}/travels/{travel_id}`
  - Bodies are `StayDoc` / `TravelDoc`, validated by the same rules as an
    import (4 and 5, factored into `check_stay` / `check_travel`).
  - Full replace; every write returns the whole trip.
  - Ownership is checked through the trip (404 otherwise).
  - No reordering: bookings are placed by time, and `position` is just
    insertion order.
- **Where the controls live:**
  - An expanded stay or travel marker gets **Edit** and **Delete**. It edits
    the *booking*, so the edit is the same from its check-in, staying,
    check-out, depart or arrive marker.
  - A day card's **Add** button becomes a small menu: Activity / Travel /
    Stay, with that date prefilled.
- **Travel form:**
  - Type (required).
  - Title, prefilled as "From → To" (Q5).
  - Carrier and number (flight or train number).
  - From location (required) and To location.
  - Departure: date, time and timezone (required).
  - Arrival: date, time and timezone (optional).
  - Confirmation number and notes.
  - **Warning, non-blocking:** with no arrival time or no "to" location, the
    form shows "No arrival yet: the timeline can't show when you land" and
    still saves. On the timeline, the depart marker carries a small warning
    badge until the arrival is filled in.
- **Timezones:** departure and arrival each have their own zone. The picker
  defaults to the trip's zone and lists first the zones already used on this
  trip, then every IANA zone (Q6). Times are entered as wall-clock values
  exactly as written on the ticket.
- **Stay form:**
  - Name and type.
  - Check-in date and time (required); check-out date and time (required).
  - Times prefill to 15:00 and 11:00 (Q8).
  - Timezone (defaults to the trip's).
  - Place, confirmation number and notes.
  - The server enforces check-out after check-in, both as instants.
- **Schema changes:**
  - A travel's `from` becomes **required**. The sample already has it.
    Existing documents without it will be rejected on import.
  - The travel types may change (Q4).
  - The schema regenerates.

### Proposed phases

- **Phase 7 — Walk: stay & travel edit API.**
  - `check_stay` / `check_travel` extracted from `check_rules`.
  - The schema changes (`from` required; types per Q4).
  - Endpoints and tests mirroring `test_items.py`, including import/edit
    parity.
- **Phase 8 — Walk: vertical timeline.** The layout above replaces the tab
  view, keeping every current behaviour: markers, entry expansion, activity
  editing, the deep link, and timezone labels. Tests are updated; phone-width
  check.
- **Phase 9 — Walk: stay & travel forms.**
  - `TravelForm` and `StayForm` (hand-written), with an IANA timezone picker.
  - Edit and Delete on markers; the Add menu.
  - The missing-arrival warning in the form and on the timeline.
  - Tests and a phone-width check.

The redesign goes *before* the new forms so their controls are built into
the new layout once, not twice.

### Open questions

1. **react-chrono, or our own vertical timeline in its style?**
   - (a) Our own: Tailwind, no dependency, no React upgrade, our design tokens.
   - (b) react-chrono 3.x plus a React 18 → 19 upgrade, moving off the
     template.
   - (c) Pin react-chrono 2.6.1 on React 18.
   - Recommendation: **(a)**.
   - **Answer:**
2. **Day cards open or collapsed by default?**
   - Recommendation: **open**, so the trip reads top to bottom. Entries stay
     collapsed until tapped.
   - **Answer:**
3. **What happens to the tab strip?**
   - (a) It becomes a compact sticky date jumper that scrolls to a day.
   - (b) Drop it and scroll only.
   - Recommendation: **(a)**. A two-week trip is a long scroll on a phone.
   - **Answer:**
4. **Travel types.** Today: flight, train, bus, ferry, car, other.
   - Add **boat** next to ferry? Anything else, such as taxi, cable car or
     walk?
   - Recommendation: add **boat** and keep the rest; "other" plus the title
     covers the rest.
   - Labels in the form: Fly, Train, Bus, Ferry, Boat, Car, Other.
   - **Answer:**
5. **Travel title: required, or derived?**
   - Recommendation: the form prefills "From → To" and you can change it.
     The schema keeps the title required.
   - **Answer:**
6. **Timezone picker.**
   - A select with the trip's zone first, then zones already used on this
     trip, then the full IANA list (about 400 entries, grouped by region).
   - The alternative is a type-to-search box.
   - Recommendation: **the grouped select** (native, which works well on
     phones).
   - **Answer:**
7. **What triggers the arrival warning?**
   - A missing arrival time, a missing "to" location, or either?
   - Recommendation: **either**, shown as one warning.
   - **Answer:**
8. **Default stay times.**
   - Prefill check-in 15:00 and check-out 11:00, editable?
   - Recommendation: **yes**.
   - **Answer:**
9. **Extra booking fields?**
   - Today travel has carrier, number, confirmation number and notes; stays
     have confirmation number and notes.
   - Add structured fields like **seat**, **terminal/gate**, **room type**,
     **booking site**, or **cost**?
   - Recommendation: **room type for stays and seat for travel only**;
     everything else lives in notes (markdown) for now.
   - **Answer:**
10. **Overlapping bookings** (two stays on the same night, two legs at once).
    - Recommendation: **save, no warning now**. Overlap checks belong to the
      verification work in the backlog, so they get designed once.
    - **Answer:**
11. **Phase order.** API, then redesign, then forms (recommended), or the
    forms first on the current tab layout?
    - **Answer:**

## After Phase 4 — First real trip

Julian provides the itinerary. We convert it to a trip document, validate it
against the schema, and import it through the UI. Anything the format can't
express goes into the backlog rather than being forced in.

## Later / Backlog

- **Walk:**
  - Editing the trip header (name, dates, timezone). Activities are done;
    stays and travel are planned above.
  - Export a trip as a document.
- **Walk:** verification/gaps, rebuilt from `docs/lessons_learned.md`. Decide up
  front whether a screen answers "is it sound?" or "what's missing?". Stay and
  travel overlap checks belong here.
- **Run:**
  - Maps and Places lookup (the server resolves coordinates; never trust
    model-supplied coordinates).
  - "What's Next" active-trip mode (derive status from dates, never store it).
  - Share links.
  - Offline/PWA.
- **Run, much later:** AI-assisted import (let the model do language, not data).
- Before any real deploy: Alembic and pinned Python dependencies.
